## First Impression with Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad term for technologies that enable machines to mimic or perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Its goal is to endow machines with capabilities such as perception, reasoning, decision-making, and language understanding.

In traditional programming, a computer follows a fixed set of machine instructions based on logic explicitly designed by the programmer. The execution process is entirely human-defined. For instance, expert systems and knowledge graphs depend on human experts to acquire knowledge from the real world, convert it into explicit rules, and encode those rules into the system.

Machine learning takes a different approach. Instead of relying on predefined rules, it learns directly from data, storing the acquired knowledge within a model. The model then applies this learned knowledge to make predictions, with the underlying logic emerging from the learning process itself rather than being manually specified.

Traditional programming is best suited for tasks where the rules are clearly defined, the environment is stable, and outcomes are deterministic, such as payroll processing, accounting systems, sorting algorithms, and encryption. 

Machine learning, on the other hand, is more appropriate when rules are complex or difficult to define explicitly, patterns need to be recognized in large datasets, or relationships are too subtle for manual coding, making it ideal for applications like image recognition, speech-to-text, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. 

In many cases, machine learning can also be used to support decision-making, particularly when dealing with uncertainty, incomplete information, or changing conditions; in such scenarios, models can provide predictions, risk scores, or rankings to guide human judgment in fields like medical diagnosis, financial risk assessment, supply chain optimization, and personalized marketing.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on using deep neural networks to solve problems. In this context, “deep” refers to the large number of layers in the neural network. Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition and generation. Large-scale models are also built on deep learning techniques.

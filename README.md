# Pathways-to-AI-From-ML-Basics-to-Large-Language-Models
## First Encounter with AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad term for technologies that enable machines to mimic or perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.  
**Goals of AI include:**
- Perception
- Reasoning
- Decision-making
- Language understanding

## Traditional Programming

- **Definition**: A computer follows a fixed set of machine instructions based on logic explicitly designed by the programmer.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Execution process is entirely human-defined.
  - Example: Expert systems and knowledge graphs depend on human experts to:
    1. Acquire knowledge from the real world.
    2. Convert that knowledge into explicit rules.
    3. Encode those rules into the system via programming.
- **Best Suited For**:
  - Well-defined rules
  - Stable environments
  - Deterministic outcomes  
- **Examples**:
  - Payroll processing
  - Accounting systems
  - Sorting algorithms
  - Encryption

## Machine Learning (ML)

- **Definition**: Learns directly from data, storing the acquired knowledge in a model.
- **Key Difference from Traditional Programming**:
  - Does not rely on predefined rules.
  - The logic for prediction emerges from the model’s learning process.
- **Best Suited For**:
  - Complex or hard-to-define rules
  - Pattern recognition in large datasets
  - Subtle relationships that are difficult to manually code
- **Applications**:
  - Image recognition
  - Speech-to-text
  - Fraud detection
  - Recommendation systems

## Machine Learning for Decision Support

- **When to Use**:
  - Uncertainty or incomplete information
  - Changing or dynamic conditions
  - **Safety-critical scenarios** where human oversight is essential
- **Role**:
  - Provides predictions, risk scores, or rankings to guide human judgment.
- **Examples**:
  - Medical diagnosis assistance
  - Financial risk assessment
  - Supply chain optimization
  - Personalized marketing

## Deep Learning (DL)

- **Definition**: A subset of machine learning that focuses on using deep neural networks to solve problems.
- **What “Deep” Means**:
  - Refers to the large number of layers in the neural network.
- **Achievements**:
  - State-of-the-art performance in:
    - Computer vision
    - Natural language processing
    - Speech recognition and generation
- **Relation to Large Models**:
  - Large-scale models are built on deep learning techniques.
